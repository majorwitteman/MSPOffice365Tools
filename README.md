# MSPOffice365Tools

## About

My first leap into source control and open source project work.

A small selection of script functions that I have created over a few years. These scripts focus on various Office 365 and Exchange Online actions that I commonly need to perform.

## To-Do

1. Some older functions need to be rebuilt to provide consistency in usage, performance, and coding practices.

    Get-AllClientMailboxFowarding

    Get-MailboxForwarding

    Get-MailboxSize

2. A lot of comments and help needs to be added to most of the functions.

3. Learn and integrate a build process; currently looking at AppVeyor.
